# Strip EXIF Data
EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format.

It’s the hidden data that your camera or phone embeds inside your photos when you take them.

I wanted to remove sensitive EXIF (location, serial numbers, capture settings) but preserve authorship (Copyright, Artist). This is an updated Windows-friendly Python script that keeps only copyright-related fields and strips everything else.
